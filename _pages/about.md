I am a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Chicago, working with Professors Yuan Ji and Brian Chiu. In this position, I conduct methodological research in Bayesian machine learning with applications to cancer clinical trials and observational studies. I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of Florida under the supervision of Prof. Michael J. Daniels. 
 



## Research Interests

My methodological research interests lie at the intersection of Bayesian statistics, causal inference, and machine learning. My work spans applications in epidemiology, marketing, and oncology.
