I am a graduate student at the University of Florida, working on my Ph.D. in Statistics. My academic advisor is Dr. Michael J. Daniels. My research interests lie at the intersection of Bayesian statistics, causal inference, and machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in developing flexible Bayesian methods for causal mediation problems using semi-parametric Bayesian machine learning models. I expect to graduate in May 2025.
