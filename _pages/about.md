I am a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Chicago, working with Professors Yuan Ji and Brian Chiu. In this position, I conduct methodological research in Bayesian machine learning with applications to cancer clinical trials and observational studies. I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of Florida under the supervision of Prof. Michael J. Daniels. My research interests lie at the intersection of Bayesian statistics, causal inference, and machine learning.
